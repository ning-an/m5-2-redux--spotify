- Redux is a global store for your state
- Even very large apps -> one big global-state object

---

When Redux was released, people were skeptical about this.

---

Redux makes this practical by letting you "combine reducers".

---

# Example state

```js
const state = {
  user: {
    name: "Bugs Bunny",
    species: "Wabbit",
  },
  orders: [
    {
      date: "01/02/03",
      items: ["carrot", "carrot", "carrot", "ACME powder"],
    },
  ],
};
```

Does this state look like 2 mini states?

---

What if we wrote two reducers?

```js
function userReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "LOG_IN": {
      return {
        name: action.name,
        species: action.species,
      };
    }

    default:
      return state;
  }
}

function orderReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "ADD_ITEM_TO_CART": {
      return {
        ...state,
        items: [...state.items, action.itemName],
      };
    }

    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

---

Redux encourages this workflow by letting you **combine reducers**:

```js
import { combineReducers } from "redux";

import userReducer from "./user-reducer";
import orderReducer from "./order-reducer";

export default combineReducers({
  user: userReducer,
  order: orderReducer,
});
```

---

The `keys` that you pass to `combineReducers` become a branch of the state.

# Exercises

Determine the initial state

---

```js
function colorReducer(state) {
  return "red";
}

function numberReducer(state) {
  return 4;
}

export default combineReducers({
  color: colorReducer,
  number: numberReducer,
});

// What is the initial state?
```

{color: 'red', number: 4}

---

```js
function itemReducer(state) {
  return { hi: 5 };
}

function locationReducer(state) {
  return "montreal";
}

export default combineReducers({
  item: itemReducer,
  location: locationReducer,
});

// What is the initial state?
```

## {item: {hi: 5}, location: 'montreal'}

```js
function petReducer(state) {
  return "cat";
}

function furnitureReducer(state) {
  return "couch";
}

export default combineReducers({
  pet: petReducer,
  household: furnitureReducer,
});

// What is the initial state?
```

## {pet: 'cat', household: 'couch'}

```js
function modalReducer(state) {
  return null;
}

function tooltipReducer(state) {
  return null;
}

function uiReducer(state) {
  return combineReducers({
    modal: modalReducer,
    tooltip: tooltipReducer,
  });
}

function dataReducer(state) {
  return { entries: [] };
}

export default combineReducers({
  data: dataReducer,
  ui: uiReducer,
});

// What is the initial state?
```

## {data: {entries: []}, ui: {modal: null, tooltip: null}}

## How it works

When you dispatch an action, it calls _all_ of your reducers.

If that action doesn't match, it returns the current state. No problem.

---

```js
function userReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "LOG_IN": {
      return {
        name: action.name,
        species: action.species,
      };
    }

    default:
      return state;
  }
}

// When `LOG_IN` is dispatched, it produces a new state.
// When `ADD_ITEM_TO_CART` is dispatched, it falls to the "default" case.
```

---

By splitting our code into reducers, we keep the code simple.

With practice, you'll learn how best to organize your Redux state.
